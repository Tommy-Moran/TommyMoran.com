New murmurs are typically assessed as outpatients unless associated with acute changes, symptoms, or within certain acute contexts where immediate investigation is necessary\u30104:10\u2020RHH_Echo_Indications.txt\u3011.\n\nNext Steps:\nComplete the paper echo request form and submit it to Cardiology Reception, Level 2.

This scenario corresponds to indications for echocardiography to rule out endocarditis, given the high risk associated with persistent cultures or if there are any new murmurs or features suggestive of endocardial infection\u30104:0\u2020RHH_Echo_Indications.txt\u3011.\n\nNext Steps:\nComplete and submit the RHH Inpatient Echo Request Form. Ensure that all relevant investigations are included, particularly any signs of endocarditis such as new murmurs or embolic phenomena. Recommendations are based on clinical appropriateness criteria, but should be discussed with the Cardiology team if there are any queries. If additional features such as new conduction abnormalities or persistent bacteremia continue, these should be escalated promptly.\n\nConsult Other Teams:\nCardiology should be consulted to discuss the findings and further management options, especially if the echocardiographic results confirm endocarditis or other cardiac involvement."
